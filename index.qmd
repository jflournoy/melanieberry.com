I am a clinical psychologist with extensive experience in developing, implementing, and evaluating programs aimed at improving outcomes for young children facing adversity. I have led national initiatives that bring together community leaders, parents, healthcare providers, and scientists to pioneer new approaches in early childhood development.

# Professional Journey

I have been working for over a decade to improve the lives of kids and families in the following professional capacities:

- Director of the Pediatric Innovation Initiative at the Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University. In this role, I led a national network focused on developing new methods to measure stress and resilience in young children.

- Director of Innovation Strategies at the same center, where I provided strategic leadership in incubating promising new programs within the Frontiers of Innovation initiative and contributed to the development of the IDEAS Impact Framework.

- Research Associate at the Stress Neurobiology and Prevention Research Laboratory at the University of Oregon, where I focused on the impact of early experiences on brain development.

# Education

I earned my Doctor of Psychology (PsyD) degree at the Stanford/PGSP Consortium in Palo Alto, CA, with a focus on early childhood development.
